  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Decoding forelimb movements from the firing activity
              of cortical neurons has been interfaced with robotic and
              prosthetic systems to replace lost upper limb functions in
              humans. Despite the potential of this approach to improve
              locomotion and facilitate gait rehabilitation, decoding lower
              limb movement from the motor cortex has received comparatively
              little attention. Here, we performed experiments to identify the
              type and amount of information that can be decoded from neuronal
              ensemble activity in the hindlimb area of the rat motor cortex
              during bipedal locomotor tasks. APPROACH: Rats were trained to
              stand, step on a treadmill, walk overground and climb staircases
              in a bipedal posture. To impose this gait, the rats were secured
              in a robotic interface that provided support against the
              direction of gravity and in the mediolateral direction, but
              behaved transparently in the forward direction. After completion
              of training, rats were chronically implanted with a micro-wire
              array spanning the left hindlimb motor cortex to record single
              and multi-unit activity, and bipolar electrodes into 10 muscles
              of the right hindlimb to monitor electromyographic signals.
              Whole-body kinematics, muscle activity, and neural signals were
              simultaneously recorded during execution of the trained tasks
              over multiple days of testing. Hindlimb kinematics, muscle
              activity, gait phases, and locomotor tasks were decoded using
              offline classification algorithms. MAIN RESULTS: We found that
              the stance and swing phases of gait and the locomotor tasks were
              detected with accuracies as robust as 90\% in all rats. Decoded
              hindlimb kinematics and muscle activity exhibited a larger
              variability across rats and tasks. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows
              that the rodent motor cortex contains useful information for
              lower limb neuroprosthetic development. However, brain-machine
              interfaces estimating gait phases or locomotor behaviors, instead
              of continuous variables such as limb joint positions or speeds,
              are likely to provide more robust control strategies for the
              design of such neuroprostheses.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Motor neuroscience and brain-machine interface (BMI)
               design is based on examining how the brain controls voluntary
               movement, typically by recording neural activity and behavior
               from animal models. Recording technologies used with these
               animal models have traditionally limited the range of behaviors
               that can be studied, and thus the generality of science and
               engineering research. We aim to design a freely-moving animal
               model using neural and behavioral recording technologies that do
               not constrain movement. APPROACH: We have established a
               freely-moving rhesus monkey model employing technology that
               transmits neural activity from an intracortical array using a
               head-mounted device and records behavior through computer vision
               using markerless motion capture. We demonstrate the flexibility
               and utility of this new monkey model, including the first
               recordings from motor cortex while rhesus monkeys walk
               quadrupedally on a treadmill. MAIN RESULTS: Using this monkey
               model, we show that multi-unit threshold-crossing neural
               activity encodes the phase of walking and that the average
               firing rate of the threshold crossings covaries with the speed
               of individual steps. On a population level, we find that neural
               state-space trajectories of walking at different speeds have
               similar rotational dynamics in some dimensions that evolve at
               the step rate of walking, yet robustly separate by speed in
               other state-space dimensions. SIGNIFICANCE: Freely-moving animal
               models may allow neuroscientists to examine a wider range of
               behaviors and can provide a flexible experimental paradigm for
               examining the neural mechanisms that underlie movement
               generation across behaviors and environments. For BMIs,
               freely-moving animal models have the potential to aid prosthetic
               design by examining how neural encoding changes with posture,
               environment and other real-world context changes. Understanding
               this new realm of behavior in more naturalistic settings is
               essential for overall progress of basic motor neuroscience and

              transient dynamics of large amplitude during the execution of
              limb movements. Traditional network models with stochastically

              these transients must be preceded by a steady-state

  abstract = "Recent physiological studies using behaving monkeys revealed
              that, in a two-alternative forced-choice visual motion
              discrimination task, reaction time was correlated with ramping of
              spike activity of lateral intraparietal cortical neurons. The
              ramping activity appears to reflect temporal accumulation, on a
              timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, of sensory evidence before
              a decision is reached. To elucidate the cellular and circuit
              basis of such integration times, we developed and investigated a
              simplified two-variable version of a biophysically realistic
              cortical network model of decision making. In this model, slow
              time integration can be achieved robustly if excitatory
              reverberation is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors; our model
              with only fast AMPA receptors at recurrent synapses produces
              decision times that are not comparable with experimental
              observations. Moreover, we found two distinct modes of network
              behavior, in which decision computation by winner-take-all
              competition is instantiated with or without attractor states for
              working memory. Decision process is closely linked to the local
              dynamics, in the ``decision space'' of the system, in the
              vicinity of an unstable saddle steady state that separates the
              basins of attraction for the two alternative choices. This
              picture provides a rigorous and quantitative explanation for the
              dependence of performance and response time on the degree of task
              difficulty, and the reason for which reaction times are longer in
              error trials than in correct trials as observed in the monkey
              experiment. Our reduced two-variable neural model offers a simple

               specialized to represent particular variables or could rely on a
               single population of PPC neurons that is leveraged in different

                   animal intelligence are deeply embodied in these evolved
                   morphologies. However, the principles governing relations
                   between environmental complexity, evolved morphology, and
                   the learnability of intelligent control, remain elusive,
                   partially due to the substantial challenge of performing
                   large-scale in silico experiments on evolution and learning.
                   We introduce Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning
                   (DERL): a novel computational framework which can evolve
                   diverse agent morphologies to learn challenging locomotion
                   and manipulation tasks in complex environments using only
                   low level egocentric sensory information. Leveraging DERL we
                   demonstrate several relations between environmental
                   complexity, morphological intelligence and the learnability
                   of control. First, environmental complexity fosters the
                   evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the
                   ability of a morphology to facilitate the learning of novel
                   tasks. Second, evolution rapidly selects morphologies that
                   learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the
                   lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the
                   lifetime of their descendants. In agents that learn and
                   evolve in complex environments, this result constitutes the
                   first demonstration of a long-conjectured morphological
                   Baldwin effect. Third, our experiments suggest a mechanistic
                   basis for both the Baldwin effect and the emergence of
                   morphological intelligence through the evolution of
                   morphologies that are more physically stable and energy
                   efficient, and can therefore facilitate learning and

              designed a task capable of disambiguating distinct types of
              representations. Our experiments revealed that human behavior is
              consistent with contingency representations, and not with
              traditional sensory models of working memory. In task-optimized
              recurrent neural networks we investigated possible circuit
              mechanisms for contingency representations and found that these
              representations can explain neurophysiological observations from
              prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks. Finally, we
              generated falsifiable predictions for neural data to identify
              contingency representations in neural data and to dissociate
              different models of working memory. Our findings characterize a

               computations are not well understood. In a dynamical system
               whose state is determined by interactions among neurons,
               computations can be rapidly reconfigured by controlling the
               system's inputs and initial conditions. To investigate whether
               the brain employs such control mechanisms, we recorded from the
               dorsomedial frontal cortex of monkeys trained to measure and
               produce time intervals in two sensorimotor contexts. The
               geometry of neural trajectories during the production epoch was
               consistent with a mechanism wherein the measured interval and
               sensorimotor context exerted control over cortical dynamics by
               adjusting the system's initial condition and input,
               respectively. These adjustments, in turn, set the speed at which
               activity evolved in the production epoch, allowing the animal to
               flexibly produce different time intervals. These results provide
               evidence that the language of dynamical systems can be used to

               that were absent in M1. At the single-neuron level, these

              circuits within the spinal cord generate backward locomotion and
              adjust it to task demands. We collected kinematic and
              electromyography data during forward and backward locomotion at
              different treadmill speeds before and after complete spinal
              transection in six adult cats (3 males and 3 females). After
              spinal transection, 5/6 cats performed backward locomotion, which
              required tonic somatosensory input in the form of perineal
              stimulation. One spinal cat performed forward locomotion but not
              backward locomotion while two others stepped backward but not
              forward. Spatiotemporal adjustments to increasing speed were
              similar in intact and spinal cats during backward locomotion and
              strategies were similar to forward locomotion, with shorter cycle
              and stance durations and longer stride lengths. Patterns of
              muscle activations, including muscle synergies, were similar for
              forward and backward locomotion in spinal cats. Indeed, we
              identified five muscle synergies that were similar during forward

              show that spinal sensorimotor circuits generate backward

              locomotion requires changing direction, including forward,
              sideways and backward. This paper shows that the center
              controlling locomotion within the spinal cord can produce a
              backward pattern when instructed by sensory signals from the
              limbs. However, the spinal locomotor network requires greater
              excitability to produce backward locomotion compared to forward
              locomotion. The paper also shows that the spinal network

              performing chronic single-unit recordings in the retrosplenial
              cortex (RSP) of the mouse and tracking the activity of individual
              AHV neurons between freely moving and head-restrained conditions,
              we find that vestibular inputs dominate AHV signalling. In
              addition, we discover that self-generated optic flow input onto
              these neurons increases the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of
              angular velocity coding during navigation. Psychophysical
              experiments and neural decoding further reveal that
              vestibular-visual integration increases the perceptual accuracy
              of egocentric angular velocity and the fidelity of its
              representation by RSP ensembles. We propose that while AHV coding
              is dependent on vestibular cues, it also utilises vision to
              maximise navigation accuracy in nocturnal and diurnal
              environments. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors

              inspiration and analogy making for researchers that focus on
              artificial neuronal networks (ANNs). Moreover, neuroscientists
              increasingly use ANNs as a model for the brain. However, apart
              from certain similarities and analogies that can be drawn between
              ANNs and BNNs, such networks exhibit marked differences,
              specifically with respect to their network topology. Here, we
              investigate to what extent network topology found in nature can
              lead to beneficial aspects in recurrent neural networks (RNNs):
              i) the prediction performance itself, that is, the capacity of
              the network to minimize the desired function at hand in test data
              and ii) speed of training, that is, how fast during training the
              network reaches its optimal performance. To this end, we examine
              different ways to construct RNNs that instantiate the network
              topology of brains of different species. We refer to such RNNs as
              bio-instantiated. We examine the bio-instantiated RNNs in the
              context of a key cognitive capacity, that is, working memory,
              defined as the ability to track task-relevant information as a
              sequence of events unfolds in time. We highlight what strategies
              can be used to construct RNNs with the network topology found in
              nature, without sacrificing prediction capacity and speed of
              training. Despite that we observe no enhancement of performance
              when compared to randomly wired RNNs, our approach demonstrates
              how empirical neural network data can be used for constructing
              RNNs, thus, facilitating further experimentation with

               box.2.The activity of 89\% MC neurons was modulated during
               locomotion. The modulation was related to the stepping
               movements, since it increased in one stepping phase and
               decreased in the next.3.MC neurons were also studied while the
               animal moved up a flat inclined surface, walking at different
               speeds, with a load of 85g attached to each forelimb, when the
               cat had to perform snakelike movements (turns) or walk on the
               flat surface placed in a horizontal plane. The pattern of MC
               neuron activity changed little under these conditions in
               comparison with uncomplicated locomotion.4.The activity of 68
               neurons was recorded in experiments with barriers and involving
               locomotion on a horizontal ladder which restricted the possible
               paw positions along the direction of locomotion. These tasks
               greatly affected the MC activity.5.Neither bilateral MC lesion

               walking along a moving floor, or locomotion involving turns and
               loaded forelimbs. On the contrary, it proved to be necessary for
               the MC to be intact for locomotion with space linked stepping
               limb movements (i.e. with barriers, on a ladder) to be
               possible.6.Bilateral destruction of the ventrolateral nucleus of

               at various speeds, with the forelimbs loaded; it could perform

               contribute to the regulation of locomotion, particularly in
               situations in which there is a requirement for precise control
               over paw placement or limb trajectory. Lesions of the
               dorsolateral funiculi at the low thoracic level (T13) that
               completely interrupted both the cortico- and rubrospinal
               pathways produced long-term deficits in locomotion on a level
               surface. These deficits included a paw-drag that was probably
               caused both by a loss of cortico- and rubrospinal input to
               motoneurones controlling distal muscles as well as by a change
               in the relative timing of muscles acting around the hip and
               knee. Smaller lesions produced similar deficits from which the
               cats recovered relatively quickly. Cats with the largest lesions
               of the dorsolateral funiculi were unable to modify their gait
               sufficiently to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill
               belt even 3--5 months postlesion. These results imply that the
               medial pathways, the reticulo- and vestibulospinal pathways, are
               unable to fully compensate for damage to the lateral pathways.
               Single unit recordings from identified pyramidal tract neurones
               (PTNs) within the hindlimb representation of the primary motor
               cortex (area 4) showed that a substantial proportion of neurones
               (67\%) significantly increased their discharge frequency when
               the cats modified their gait to step over obstacles attached to
               the treadmill belt. Of those PTNs that showed increased activity
               during the swing phase, populations of neurones were activated
               at different times. A large proportion of PTNS discharged early
               in swing, in phase with knee flexors such as the semitendinosus.
               Others discharged slightly later, in phase with the activity of
               ankle flexors, such as tibialis anterior, while still others
               discharged at the end of swing, in phase with digit
               dorsiflexors, such as the extensor digitorum brevis. We suggest
               that different populations of cortical neurones may specifically
               modify the activity of selected groups of close synergistic
               muscles during different parts of the swing phase. We further
               suggest that these modifications are mediated, in part, by
               groups of interneurones that are involved in determining the
               base locomotor rhythm. This provides a means by which the
               changes specified by the descending signal from the motor cortex
               may be smoothly, and appropriately, incorporated into the
               locomotor cycle.",

              'What do I need and Why, Where and When can this be obtained, and

              principles underlying the neuronal solutions to H4W using a
              combination of neurobiological and neurorobotic approaches.
              First, we analyse H4W from a system-level perspective by mapping
              its objectives onto the Distributed Adaptive Control embodied
              cognitive architecture which sees the generation of adaptive
              action in the real world as the primary task of the brain rather
              than optimally solving abstract problems. We next map this
              functional decomposition to the architecture of the rodent brain
              to test its consistency. Following this approach, we propose that
              the mammalian brain solves the H4W problem on the basis of
              multiple kinds of outcome predictions, integrating central
              representations of needs and drives (e.g. hypothalamus), valence
              (e.g. amygdala), world, self and task state spaces (e.g.
              neocortex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, respectively)

              analysis, goal-directed behaviour results from a well-structured
              architecture in which goals are bootstrapped on the basis of
              predefined needs, valence and multiple learning, memory and

              navigational capabilities are guided by orientation directing
              vectors generated by a process called path integration. During
              this process, they integrate compass and odometric cues to
              estimate their current location as a vector, called the home
              vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They
              further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector
              memories globally to the nest or based on visual landmarks.
              Although existing computational models reproduced similar
              behaviors, a neurocomputational model of vector navigation
              including the acquisition of vector representations has not been
              described before. Here we present a model of neural mechanisms in
              a modular closed-loop control-enabling vector navigation in
              artificial agents. The model consists of a path integration
              mechanism, reward-modulated global learning, random search, and
              action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates
              compass and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation
              of the agent's current location as neural activity patterns in
              circular arrays. A reward-modulated learning rule enables the
              acquisition of vector memories by associating the local food
              reward with the path integration state. A motor output is
              computed based on the combination of vector memories and random
              exploration. In simulation, we show that the neural mechanisms
              enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence of
              external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to
              goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under
              realistic conditions. Consequently, we provide a novel approach
              for vector learning and navigation in a simulated, situated agent
              linking behavioral observations to their possible underlying
              neural substrates.",

  abstract = "Robot navigation is a fundamental problem in robotics and various
              approaches have been developed to cope with this problem. Despite
              the great success of previous approaches, learning-based methods
              are receiving growing interest in the research community. They
              have shown great efficiency in solving navigation tasks and offer
              considerable promise to build intelligent navigation systems.
              This paper presents a goal-directed robot navigation system that
              integrates global planning based on goal-directed end-to-end
              learning and local planning based on reinforcement learning (RL).
              The proposed system aims to navigate the robot to desired goal
              positions while also being adaptive to changes in the
              environment. The global planner is trained to imitate an expert's
              navigation between different positions by goal-directed
              end-to-end learning, where both the goal representations and
              local observations are incorporated to generate actions. However,
              it is trained in a supervised fashion and is weak in dealing with
              changes in the environment. To solve this problem, a local
              planner based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is designed.
              The local planner is first implemented in a simulator and then
              transferred to the real world. It works complementarily to deal
              with situations that have not been met during training the global
              planner and is able to generalize over different situations. The

              We acquire the visual data from a camera mounted on a small
              tele-operated vehicle. The camera has a panoramic field of view
              with its focal point approximately 5 cm above the ground level,
              similar to what would be expected from a rat's point of view.
              Using established algorithms for calculating perceptual speed
              from the apparent rate of visual change over time, we generate
              raw dead reckoning information which loses spatial fidelity over
              time due to error accumulation. We rectify the loss of fidelity

              can be accurately described by low-dimensional dynamics unfolding
              from specific initial conditions on every trial. These

  abstract = "Glutamatergic reticulospinal neurons in the gigantocellular
              reticular nucleus (GRN) of the medullary reticular formation can
              function as command neurons, transmitting motor commands to
              spinal cord circuits. Recent advances in our understanding of
              this neuron-dense region have been facilitated by the discovery
              of expression of the transcriptional regulator, Chx10, in
              excitatory reticulospinal neurons. Here, we address the capacity
              of local circuitry in the GRN to contribute to reticulospinal
              output. We define two sub-populations of Chx10-expressing neurons
              in this region, based on distinct electrophysiological properties
              and somata size (small and large), and show that these correspond
              to local interneurons and reticulospinal neurons, respectively.
              Using focal release of caged-glutamate combined with patch clamp
              recordings, we demonstrated that Chx10 neurons form microcircuits
              in which the Chx10 interneurons project to and facilitate the
              firing of Chx10 reticulospinal neurons. We discuss the
              implications of these microcircuits in terms of movement
              selection. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Reticulospinal neurons in the
              medullary reticular formation play a key role in movement. The
              transcriptional regulator Chx10 defines a population of
              glutamatergic neurons in this region, a proportion of which have
              been shown to be involved in stopping, steering, and modulating
              locomotion. While it has been shown that these neurons integrate
              descending inputs, we asked whether local processing also
              ultimately contributes to reticulospinal outputs. Here, we define
              Chx10-expressing medullary reticular formation interneurons and
              reticulospinal neurons, and demonstrate how the former modulate
              the output of the latter. The results shed light on the internal

              methods are a promising approach due to their ability to uncover
              meaningful relationships from large, complex, and noisy datasets.
              When applied to high-D spiking data from motor cortex (M1) during
              stereotyped behaviors, they offer improvements in the ability to
              uncover dynamics and their relation to subjects' behaviors on a

              less-structured behaviors, or in brain areas that are not
              well-modeled by autonomous dynamics, is far more challenging,
              because deep learning methods often require careful hand-tuning
              of complex model hyperparameters (HPs). Here we demonstrate

  abstract  = "How do supraspinal circuits produce the diversity of locomotor
               outputs needed for an animal's survival? To answer this
               question, I study the reticulospinal (RS) system of larval
               zebrafish, as these cells provide the main source of descending
               motor control. I combine two-photon calcium imaging of RS
               neurons with high-speed behavioural tracking to study RS
               activity across a range of kinematically distinct swim types.
               Examination of reticulospinal recruitment across different swim
               types has revealed unique, but partially overlapping activity
               patterns, suggesting that some cells encode kinematics common to
               multiple swim types, while others encode kinematics which are
               characteristic of a specific swim type. By developing
               regression-based encoding models which describe a cell's
               activity using low-level tail kinematics, we identify
               ``kinematic modules''. These modules contain cells with similar
               kinematic encoding and thus represent the core combinations of
               kinematic features encoded by RS activity. I find that laser
               ablation of cells within a module produce specific kinematic
               deficits without affecting shared elements of locomotion. This
               data suggest a circuit architecture where kinematic modules can
               be differentially combined to produce locomotor diversity
               through the context-specific recruitment of particular groups of
               RS neurons. I also describe a novel preparation for the imaging
               of fluorescent activity indicators in larval zebrafish using an
               acousto-optic lens microscope. This methodology allows for rapid
               3D point scanning of the entire reticulospinal complex during
               visual stimulus presentation and behavioural tracking. The
               improved temporal resolution and sampling across the whole

               reach) to improve outcomes. The basal ganglia are a critical
               nexus where circuits necessary for the production of behaviour,
               such as the neocortex and thalamus, are integrated with reward
               signalling to reinforce successful, purposive actions. The
               dorsal striatum, a major input structure of basal ganglia, is
               composed of two opponent pathways, direct and indirect, thought
               to select actions that elicit positive outcomes and suppress
               actions that do not, respectively. Activity-dependent plasticity
               modulated by reward is thought to be sufficient for selecting
               actions in the striatum. Although perturbations of basal ganglia
               function produce profound changes in movement, it remains
               unknown whether activity-dependent plasticity is sufficient to
               produce learned changes in movement kinematics, such as
               velocity. Here we use cell-type-specific stimulation in mice

               activity in either the direct or indirect pathway is sufficient
               to produce specific and sustained increases or decreases in
               velocity, without affecting action selection or motivation.
               These behavioural changes were a form of learning that
               accumulated over trials, persisted after the cessation of
               stimulation, and were abolished in the presence of dopamine

              measurements of brain activity. These analyses have proved a
              sensitive test of whether given brain regions provide information
              about specific perceptual or cognitive processes. An exciting
              extension of this approach is to infer the structure of this
              information, thereby drawing conclusions about the underlying
              neural representational space. These approaches rely on
              exploratory data-driven dimensionality reduction to extract the
              natural dimensions of neural spaces, including natural visual
              object and scene representations, semantic and conceptual
              knowledge, and working memory. However, the efficacy of these
              exploratory methods is unknown, because they have only been
              applied to representations in brain areas for which we have
              little or no secondary knowledge. One of the best-understood
              areas of the cerebral cortex is area MT of primate visual cortex,

              classifier performance, dimensionality reduction rarely revealed

              illustrate important limitations of these analyses, and suggest a

              function as command neurons, transmitting motor commands to
              spinal cord circuits. Recent advances in our understanding of
              this neuron-dense region have been facilitated by the discovery
              of expression of the transcriptional regulator, Chx10, in
              excitatory reticulospinal neurons. Here, we address the capacity
              of local circuitry in the GRN to contribute to reticulospinal
              output. We define two sub-populations of Chx10-expressing neurons

              Using focal release of caged-glutamate combined with patch clamp

              glutamatergic neurons in this region, a proportion of which have
              been shown to be involved in stopping, steering, and modulating
              locomotion. While it has been shown that these neurons integrate
              descending inputs, we asked whether local processing also
              ultimately contributes to reticulospinal outputs. Here, we define
              Chx10-expressing medullary reticular formation interneurons and
              reticulospinal neurons, and demonstrate how the former modulate
              the output of the latter. The results shed light on the internal
              organization and microcircuit formation of reticular formation

               driven by a modified distribution of muscle afferents at

               outputs needed for an animal's survival? To answer this
               question, I study the reticulospinal (RS) system of larval
               zebrafish, as these cells provide the main source of descending
               motor control. I combine two-photon calcium imaging of RS
               neurons with high-speed behavioural tracking to study RS
               activity across a range of kinematically distinct swim types.
               Examination of reticulospinal recruitment across different swim
               types has revealed unique, but partially overlapping activity
               patterns, suggesting that some cells encode kinematics common to
               multiple swim types, while others encode kinematics which are
               characteristic of a specific swim type. By developing
               regression-based encoding models which describe a cell's
               activity using low-level tail kinematics, we identify
               ``kinematic modules''. These modules contain cells with similar
               kinematic encoding and thus represent the core combinations of
               kinematic features encoded by RS activity. I find that laser
               ablation of cells within a module produce specific kinematic
               deficits without affecting shared elements of locomotion. This
               data suggest a circuit architecture where kinematic modules can

               of fluorescent activity indicators in larval zebrafish using an
               acousto-optic lens microscope. This methodology allows for rapid
               3D point scanning of the entire reticulospinal complex during

               improved temporal resolution and sampling across the whole

              variety of different ways. For example, cells that discriminated
              between clockwise and counterclockwise turns did so with either
              antagonistic responses or simple excitation or inhibition. Others

              in defensive action selection has been elucidated, top-down
              modulation of brainstem locomotor circuitry remains unclear. Here
              we provide evidence for the existence and functionality of a
              monosynaptic connection from the central amygdala (CeA) to the
              mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) that inhibits locomotion in

              that locomotion stimulated by airpuff coincides with increased
              activity of MLR glutamatergic neurons. Using retrograde tracing
              and ex vivo electrophysiology, we find that the CeA makes a
              monosynaptic connection with the MLR. In the open field, in vivo
              stimulation of this projection suppressed spontaneous locomotion,
              whereas inhibition of this projection had no effect. However,
              inhibiting CeA terminals within the MLR increased both neural
              activity and locomotor responses to airpuff. Finally, using a
              conditioned avoidance paradigm known to activate CeA neurons, we
              find that inhibition of the CeA projection increased successful
              escape, whereas activating the projection reduced escape.

               leaving us the challenge of reconstructing their targets of
               control and mechanisms of dexterity. In this review we explore a
               corner of this fascinating world. We describe mathematical
               models for legged animal locomotion, focusing on rapidly running
               insects and highlighting past achievements and challenges that
               remain. Newtonian body--limb dynamics are most naturally
               formulated as piecewise-holonomic rigid body mechanical systems,
               whose constraints change as legs touch down or lift off. Central
               pattern generators and proprioceptive sensing require models of
               spiking neurons and simplified phase oscillator descriptions of
               ensembles of them. A full neuromechanical model of a running
               animal requires integration of these elements, along with
               proprioceptive feedback and models of goal-oriented sensing,
               planning, and learning. We outline relevant background material
               from biomechanics and neurobiology, explain key properties of
               the hybrid dynamical systems that underlie legged locomotion

               Glutamatergic GRN outputs to the spinal cord appear to be gated

              of V2a neurons of the rostral medulla stops ongoing locomotor

              movements and a change in the animal's heading in response to
              multiple sensory modalities. While much research has focused on
              the circuits for sensory integration, chiefly to the midbrain
              superior colliculus (SC), the downstream cells and circuits that
              engage adequate motor actions have remained elusive. Furthermore,
              the mechanisms supporting trajectory changes are still
              speculative. Here, using transneuronal viral tracings in mice, we
              show that brainstem V2a neurons, a genetically defined subtype of
              glutamatergic neurons of the reticular formation, receive
              putative synaptic inputs from the contralateral SC. This makes
              them a candidate relay of lateralized orienting commands. We next
              show that unilateral optogenetic activations of brainstem V2a
              neurons in vivo evoked ipsilateral orienting-like responses of
              the head and the nose tip on stationary mice. When animals are
              walking, similar stimulations impose a transient locomotor arrest
              followed by a change of trajectory. Third, we reveal that these
              distinct motor actions are controlled by dedicated V2a subsets
              each projecting to a specific spinal cord segment, with at least
              (1) a lumbar-projecting subset whose unilateral activation
              specifically controls locomotor speed but neither impacts
              trajectory nor evokes orienting movements, and (2) a
              cervical-projecting subset dedicated to head orientation, but not
              to locomotor speed. Activating the latter subset suffices to
              steer the animals' directional heading, placing the head
              orientation as the prime driver of locomotor trajectory. V2a
              neurons and their modular organization may therefore underlie the

               locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on

               because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible:

              during MLR stimulation is poorly documented. Objective/hypothesis
              We investigated whether freely behaving mice could brake or turn
              based on environmental cues during MLR stimulation. Methods We
              stimulated the cuneiform nucleus in mice expressing
              channelrhodopsin in Vglut2-positive neurons in a Cre-dependent
              manner (Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP) using optogenetics. We detected
              locomotor movements using deep learning. We used patch-clamp
              recordings to validate the functional expression of
              channelrhodopsin and neuroanatomy to visualize the stimulation
              sites. Results Optogenetic stimulation of the MLR evoked
              locomotion and increasing laser power increased locomotor speed.
              Gait diagram and limb kinematics were similar during spontaneous
              and optogenetic-evoked locomotion. Mice could brake and make
              sharp turns (∼90⁰) when approaching a corner during MLR
              stimulation in an open-field arena. The speed during the turn was
              scaled with the speed before the turn, and with the turn angle.
              In a reporter mouse, many Vglut2-ZsGreen neurons were
              immunopositive for glutamate in the MLR. Patch-clamp recordings
              in Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP mice show that blue light evoked short
              latency spiking in MLR neurons. Conclusion MLR glutamatergic
              neurons are a relevant target to improve locomotor activity
              without impeding the ability to brake and turn when approaching
              an obstacle, thus ensuring smooth and adaptable navigation.

              constraints of the muscles attached to the skeleton and the
              neuronal circuits controlling and coordinating muscle activities.
              Quadrupeds exhibit a wide range of locomotor gaits. Given our
              advances in the genetic identification of spinal and supraspinal
              circuits important to locomotion in the mouse, it is now
              important to get a better understanding of the full repertoire of
              gaits in the freely walking mouse. To assess this range, young
              adult C57BL/6J mice were trained to walk and run on a treadmill
              at different locomotor speeds. Instead of using the classical
              paradigm defining gaits according to their footfall pattern, we
              combined the inter-limb coupling and the duty cycle of the stance
              phase, thus identifying several types of gaits: lateral walk,
              trot, out-of-phase walk, rotary gallop, transverse gallop, hop,
              half-bound, and full-bound. Out-of-phase walk, trot, and
              full-bound were robust and appeared to function as attractor
              gaits (i.e., a state to which the network flows and stabilizes)
              at low, intermediate, and high speeds respectively. In contrast,
              lateral walk, hop, transverse gallop, rotary gallop, and
              half-bound were more transient and therefore considered
              transitional gaits (i.e., a labile state of the network from
              which it flows to the attractor state). Surprisingly, lateral
              walk was less frequently observed. Using graph analysis, we
              demonstrated that transitions between gaits were predictable, not
              random. In summary, the wild-type mouse exhibits a wider
              repertoire of locomotor gaits than expected. Future locomotor
              studies should benefit from this paradigm in assessing transgenic
              mice or wild-type mice with neurotraumatic injury or

              in detail the various space and time parameters of limb

              animal used a symmetrical or non-symmetrical gait. In symmetrical
              gaits, the increase of velocity generally results equally from an
              increase in the stride frequency and the stride length. On the
              other hand, in non-symmetrical gaits, the increase in velocity is
              achieved differently according to the level of velocity used. As
              speed increases, velocity increases first as a consequence of
              increased stride frequency, then as in symmetrical gaits, by an
              equal increase in both variables, and finally at high speed,
              velocity increases through increased stride length. In both
              symmetrical and non-symmetrical gaits, stance and swing-time

  abstract = "Turning is a requirement for locomotion on the variable terrain
              that most terrestrial animals inhabit and is a deciding factor in
              many predator-prey interactions. Despite this, the kinematics and
              mechanics of quadrupedal turns are not well understood. To gain
              insight to the turning kinematics of small quadrupedal mammals,
              six adult wild mice were videotaped at 250 Hz from below as they
              performed 90 degrees running turns. Four markers placed along the
              sagittal axis were digitized to allow observation of lateral
              bending and body rotation throughout the turn. Ground contact
              periods of the fore- and hindlimbs were also noted for each
              frame. During turning, mice increased their ground contact time,
              but did not change their stride frequency relative to straight
              running at maximum speed. Postcranial body rotation preceded
              deflection in heading, and did not occur in one continuous
              motion, but rather in bouts of 15-53 degrees. These bouts were
              synchronized with the stride cycle, such that the majority of
              rotation occurred during the second half of forelimb support and
              the first half of hindlimb support. In this phase of the stride
              cycle, the trunk was sagittally flexed and rotational inertia was
              65\% of that during maximal extension. By synchronizing body
              rotation with this portion of the stride cycle, mice can achieve
              a given angular acceleration with much lower applied torque.
              Compared with humans running along curved trajectories, mice
              maintained relatively higher speeds at proportionately smaller
              radii. A possible explanation for this difference lies in the
              more crouched limb posture of mice, which increases the
              mechanical advantage for horizontal ground force production. The
              occurrence of body rotation prior to deflection in heading may
              facilitate acceleration in the new direction by making use of the
              relatively greater force production inherent in the parasagittal
              limb posture of mice.",

              the stride frequency and the stride length if the animal showed a
              symmetrical or an asymmetrical gait. In symmetrical gaits, the
              increase of velocity is provided by an equal increase in the
              stride length and the stride frequency. In asymmetrical gaits,
              the increase in velocity is mainly assured by an increase in the
              stride frequency in velocities ranging from 15 to 29 cm s(-1).
              Above 68 cm s(-1), velocity increase is achieved by stride length

              However, the literature in mammals shows a wide difference of
              results between the kinematics of treadmill and overground
              locomotion. To study these discrepancies, we analyzed the
              locomotion of adult SWISS-OF1 mice over a large range of
              velocities using treadmill and overground track. The use of a
              high-speed video camera combined with cinefluoroscopic equipment
              allowed us to quantify in detail the various space and time
              parameters of limb kinematics. The results show that mice
              maintain the same gait pattern in both conditions. However, they
              also demonstrate that during treadmill exercise mice always
              exhibit higher stride frequency and consequently lower stride
              length. The relationship of the stance time and the swing time
              against the stride frequency are still the same in both
              conditions. We conclude that the conflict related to the
              discrepancy between the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual
              inputs contribute to an increase in the stride frequency during
              the treadmill locomotion.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gait analysis forms a critical part of many lab
              workflows, ranging from those interested in preclinical
              neurological models to others who use locomotion as part of a
              standard battery of tests. Unfortunately, while paw detection can
              be semi-automated, it becomes generally a time-consuming process
              with error corrections. Improvement in paw tracking would aid in
              better gait analysis performance and experience. NEW METHOD: Here
              we show the use of Visual Gait Lab (VGL), a high-level software
              with an intuitive, easy to use interface, that is built on
              DeepLabCut™. VGL is optimized to generate gait metrics and allows
              for quick manual error corrections. VGL comes with a single
              executable, streamlining setup on Windows systems. We demonstrate
              the use of VGL to analyze gait. RESULTS: Training and evaluation
              of VGL were conducted using 200 frames (80/20 train-test split)
              of video from mice walking on a treadmill. The trained network
              was then used to visually track paw placements to compute gait
              metrics. These are processed and presented on the screen where
              the user can rapidly identify and correct errors. COMPARISON WITH
              EXISTING METHODS: Gait analysis remains cumbersome, even with
              commercial software due to paw detection errors. DeepLabCut™ is
              an alternative that can improve visual tracking but is not
              optimized for gait analysis functionality. CONCLUSIONS: VGL
              allows for gait analysis to be performed in a rapid, unbiased
              manner, with a set-up that can be easily implemented and executed
              by those without a background in computer programming.",

  abstract = "The direction and speed of escape locomotion can affect the
              ability of an animal to evade a predator, and variation in
              habitat structure often affects speed. Consequently, the escape
              paths chosen by animals may affect their performance and
              subsequent survival. Arboreal locomotion is well suited for
              gaining insight into the choice of escape routes because of the
              discrete paths formed by branches. Decreased branch diameter and
              increased angles between branches can significantly decrease
              locomotor speeds, but no previous study has determined whether
              arboreal lizards selectively choose alternative paths. We
              quantified choice of escape paths and locomotor performance of
              four syntopic species of arboreal Anolis lizards in their natural
              habitat and in the laboratory. In the field, species with shorter
              limbs occurred more commonly on narrow perches than did
              long-limbed species, but all species favoured escape paths with
              larger-diameter perches and straighter interperch angles. Thus,
              short-limbed species used narrower perches than long-limbed
              species merely as a result of what they encountered, rather than
              as a result of a biased choice at branching points. In natural
              vegetation, choosing branches with the largest diameter often
              results in the straightest path. However, in the laboratory, most
              lizards preferred large-diameter perches with a sharp turn to
              continuing a straight path onto a small-diameter perch. Although
              an overriding preference for larger perch diameter may optimize
              escape speed within a single perch, a maladaptive side-effect
              could be a compromise of the overall rate of gaining distance
              from starting points in paths with turns.",

               to descending tracts. Glutamate antagonists block mesencephalic
               locomotor region-induced and spontaneous locomotion, and
               glutamatergic agonists induce locomotion in spinal animals. NA
               and 5-HT inputs to the spinal cord originate in the brainstem,
               while the descending dopaminergic pathway originates in the
               hypothalamus. Agonists acting at NA, DA or 5-HT receptors
               facilitate or induce locomotion in spinal animals. 5-HT neurons
               located in the parapyramidal region (PPR) produce locomotion
               when stimulated in the isolated neonatal rat brainstem-spinal
               cord preparation, and they constitute the first anatomically
               discrete group of spinally-projecting neurons demonstrated to be
               involved in the initiation of locomotion in mammals. Neurons in
               the PPR are activated during treadmill locomotion in adult rats.
               Locomotion evoked from the PPR is mediated by 5-HT(7) and
               5-HT(2A) receptors, and 5-HT(7) antagonists block locomotion in
               cat, rat and mouse preparations, but have little effect in mice
               lacking 5-HT(7) receptors. 5-HT induced activity in 5-HT(7)
               knockout mice is rhythmic, but coordination among flexor and
               extensor motor nuclei and left and right sides of the spinal
               cord is disrupted. In the adult wild-type mouse, 5-HT(7)
               receptor antagonists impair locomotion, producing patterns of
               activity resembling those induced by 5-HT in 5-HT(7) knockout
               mice. 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists have a reduced effect on
               locomotion in adult 5-HT(7) receptor knockout mice. We conclude
               that the PPR is the source of a descending 5-HT command pathway
               that activates the CPG via 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(2A) receptors.

               The region was named Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR). Since

               various vertebrate species, including the lamprey, salamander,

              spontaneous behavioural responses in the mouse represents a
              powerful approach to study how the mammalian brain processes
              sensory information and selects appropriate motor actions. For
              visually and auditory guided behaviours the relevant action has
              been empirically identified as a change in locomotion state.
              However, the extent to which locomotion alone captures the
              diversity of those behaviours and their sensory specificity is
              unknown.To tackle this problem we developed a method to obtain a
              faithful 3D reconstruction of the mouse body that enabled us to
              quantify a wide variety of movements and changes in postures.
              This higher dimensional description of behaviour revealed that
              responses to different sensory inputs is more stimulus-specific
              than indicated by locomotion data alone. Thus, equivalent
              locomotion patterns evoked by different stimuli (e.g. looming and
              sound evoking locomotion arrest) could be well separated along
              other dimensions. The enhanced stimulus-specificity was explained
              by a surprising diversity of behavioural responses. A clustering
              analysis revealed that distinct combinations of motor actions and
              postures, giving rise to at least 7 different behaviours, were
              required to account for stimulus-specificity. Moreover, each
              stimulus evoked more than one behaviour revealing a robust
              one-to-many mapping between sensations and behaviours that could
              not be detected from locomotion data.Our results challenge the
              current view of visually and auditory guided behaviours as purely
              locomotion-based actions (e.g. freeze, escape) and indicate that
              behavioural diversity and sensory specificity unfold in a higher

              (V1), locomotion-related neural activity influences sensory gain,
              encodes running speed, and predicts the direction of visual flow.
              As most experiments exploring movement-related modulation of V1

              modulate V1 neuronal activity in a direction-specific manner that
              also depends on the presence or absence of light. We identify two

              been shown to control head orienting movements. These results

              of tectum in integrating eye, body orientation, and locomotor
              movements as in steering and goal-directed behavior. Electrical
              stimuli were applied to different areas within the optic tectum
              in head-restrained semi-intact lampreys (n = 40). Motions of the
              eyes and body were recorded simultaneously (videotaped). Brief
              pulse trains (0.5 s) lateral bending movements of the body
              (orientation movements) were added, and with even longer stimuli
              locomotor movements were initiated. Depending on the tectal area
              stimulated, four characteristic response patterns were observed.
              In a lateral area conjugate horizontal eye movements combined
              with lateral bending movements of the body and locomotor
              movements were elicited, depending on stimulus duration. The
              amplitude of the eye movement and bending movements was site
              specific within this region. In a rostromedial area, bilateral
              downward vertical eye movements occurred. In a caudomedial tectal
              area, large-amplitude undulatory body movements akin to
              struggling behavior were elicited, combined with large-amplitude
              eye movements that were antiphasic to the body movements. The
              alternating eye movements were not dependent on vestibuloocular
              reflexes. Finally, in a caudolateral area locomotor movements
              without eye or bending movements could be elicited. These results

  abstract  = "The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct input from the
               retina and integrates it with information about sound, touch,
               and state of the animal that is relayed from other parts of the
               brain to initiate specific behavioral outcomes. The superficial
               SC layers (sSC) contain cells that respond to visual stimuli,
               whereas the deep SC layers (dSC) contain cells that also respond
               to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Here, we used a
               large-scale silicon probe recording system to examine the visual
               response properties of SC cells of head-fixed and alert male
               mice. We found cells with diverse response properties including:
               (1) orientation/direction-selective (OS/DS) cells with a firing
               rate that is suppressed by drifting sinusoidal gratings
               (negative OS/DS cells); (2) suppressed-by-contrast cells; (3)
               cells with complex-like spatial summation nonlinearity; and (4)
               cells with Y-like spatial summation nonlinearity. We also found
               specific response properties that are enriched in different
               depths of the SC. The sSC is enriched with cells with small RFs,
               high evoked firing rates (FRs), and sustained temporal
               responses, whereas the dSC is enriched with the negative OS/DS
               cells and with cells with large RFs, low evoked FRs, and
               transient temporal responses. Locomotion modulates the activity
               of the SC cells both additively and multiplicatively and changes
               the preferred spatial frequency of some SC cells. These results
               provide the first description of the negative OS/DS cells and
               demonstrate that the SC segregates cells with different response
               properties and that the behavioral state of a mouse affects SC
               activity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The superior colliculus (SC)
               receives visual input from the retina in its superficial layers
               (sSC) and induces eye/head-orientating movements and innate
               defensive responses in its deeper layers (dSC). Despite their
               importance, very little is known about the visual response
               properties of dSC neurons. Using high-density electrode
               recordings and novel model-based analysis, we found several
               novel visual response properties of the SC cells, including
               encoding of a cell's preferred orientation or direction by
               suppression of the firing rate. The sSC and the dSC are enriched
               with cells with different visual response properties. Locomotion
               modulates the cells in the SC. These findings contribute to our
               understanding of how the SC processes visual inputs, a critical
               step in comprehending visually guided behaviors.",

               these behaviors. However, the molecular identities of mammalian
               reticular formation neurons that mediate motor behaviors have
               not yet been determined, thus limiting their study in health and
               disease. In the medullary reticular formation of the mouse, we
               identified neurons that express the transcription factors Lhx3
               and/or Chx10, and demonstrate that these neurons form a
               significant component of glutamatergic reticulospinal pathways.
               Lhx3-positive medullary reticular formation neurons express Fos

               are active during walking. Furthermore, they receive functional

               electrophysiological properties to support tonic repetitive

              persistent states are maintained in the brain, which upstream

              exert neuromodulatory effects on sensory perception and

              that zebrafish spontaneously alternate between two persistent
              internal states during foraging for live prey (Paramecia). In the
              exploitation state, the animal inhibits locomotion and promotes
              hunting, generating small, localized trajectories. In the

              hunting, generating long-ranging trajectories that enhance
              spatial dispersion. We uncover a dorsal raphe subpopulation with
              persistent activity that robustly encodes the exploitation state.
              The exploitation-state-encoding neurons, together with a
              multimodal trigger network that is associated with state
              transitions, form a stochastically activated nonlinear dynamical
              system. The activity of this oscillatory network correlates with
              a global retuning of sensorimotor transformations during foraging

              prey and the accuracy of motor sequences during hunting. This

              midbrain structure known to be important for controlling the

               unanesthetized decerebrate cats during fictive locomotion were
               analyzed prior to, during, and after cold block of the medial
               reticular formation (MedRF) or the low thoracic ventral
               funiculus (VF). As others have shown, electrical stimulation of
               the MLR typically evoked short-latency excitatory or mixed
               excitatory/inhibitory PSPs in flexor and extensor motoneurons.
               The bulbospinal conduction velocities averaged approximately 88
               m/s (range: 62-145 m/s) and segmental latencies for EPSPs ranged
               from 1.2 to 10.9 ms. The histogram of segmental latencies showed
               three peaks, suggesting di-, tri-, and polysynaptic linkages.
               Segmental latencies for IPSPs suggested trisynaptic or
               polysynaptic transmission. Most EPSPs (69/77) were significantly
               larger during the depolarized phase of the intracellular
               locomotor drive potential (LDP), and most IPSPs (35/46) were
               larger during the corresponding hyperpolarized phase. Bilateral
               cooling of the MedRF reversibly abolished locomotion of both
               hindlimbs as measured from the electroneurogram (ENG) activity
               of muscle nerves and simultaneously abolished or diminished the
               motoneuron PSPs and LDPs. Unilateral cooling of the VF blocked
               locomotion ipsilaterally and diminished it contralaterally with
               concomitant loss or decrease the motoneuron PSPs and LDPs.
               Relative to the side of motoneuron recording, cooling of the
               ipsilateral VF sometimes uncovered longer-latency EPSPs, whereas
               cooling of the contralateral VF abolished longer-latency EPSPs.
               It is concluded that MLR stimulation activates a pathway that
               relays in the MedRF and descends bilaterally in the VF to
               contact spinal interneurons that project to motoneurons. Local
               segmental pathways that activate or inhibit motoneurons during

              used electrical microstimulation to identify brain regions that
              promote locomotion, but the identity of neurons that act as key
              intermediaries between higher motor planning centres and
              executive circuits in the spinal cord has remained controversial.
              Here we show that the mouse caudal brainstem encompasses
              functionally heterogeneous neuronal subpopulations that have
              differential effects on locomotion. These subpopulations are
              distinguishable by location, neurotransmitter identity and
              connectivity. Notably, glutamatergic neurons within the lateral
              paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi), a small subregion in the
              caudal brainstem, are essential to support high-speed locomotion,
              and can positively tune locomotor speed through inputs from
              glutamatergic neurons of the upstream midbrain locomotor region.
              By contrast, glycinergic inhibitory neurons can induce different

              a separate unknown system directs asymmetric movements---the
              ability to move left or right. Here we report the discovery that
              Chx10-lineage reticulospinal neurons act to control the direction
              of locomotor movements in mammals. Chx10 neurons exhibit
              ipsilateral projection, and can decrease spinal limb-based
              locomotor activity ipsilaterally. This circuit mechanism acts as
              the basis for left or right locomotor movements in freely moving
              animals: selective unilateral activation of Chx10 neurons causes
              ipsilateral movements whereas inhibition causes contralateral
              movements. Spontaneous forward locomotion is thus transformed
              into an ipsilateral movement by braking locomotion on the

               receiving increased attention as valuable models for animal

               has attracted the interest of ecologists and behaviorists in
               relation to its functional role in predator?prey interactions.
               Escape trajectories (ETs) as considered in this article refer to
               the initial prey response to a predator's attack. Such a
               trajectory should be measured at the end of the main rotational

  abstract = "Hierarchy is a candidate organizing principle of ethology, where
              actions grouped into higher order chunks combine in specific ways
              to generate adaptive behavior. However, demonstrations of
              hierarchical organization in behavior have been scarce. Moreover,
              it remains unclear how such underlying organization allows for
              behavioral flexibility. Here we uncover the hierarchical and
              flexible nature of Caenorhabditis elegans behavior. By describing
              worm locomotion as a sequence of discrete postural templates, we
              identified chunks containing mutually substitutable postures
              along the dynamics. We then elucidated the rules governing their
              interactions. We found that stereotypical roaming can be
              described by a specific sequence of postural chunks, which
              exhibit flexibility at the lowest postural level. The same chunks
              get combined differently to produce dwelling, capturing
              non-stereotypical actions across timescales. We show that worm
              foraging is organized hierarchically ---a feature not explainable
              via Markovian dynamics---, and derive a context-free grammar
              governing its behavior ---which is different than a regular
              grammar, or a hidden Markov chain. In sum, in making the analogy
              with human language concrete (but not literal) our work
              demonstrates, in line with the foundational insights of classical
              ethologists, that spontaneous behavior is orderly flexible. Once
              more, investigating the humble nematode suggests that everything
              human has its roots in lower animal behavior. ![Figure][1]

              interaction of an individual (evader) and an obstacle (pursuer).
              We have developed a mathematical model with predictive and
              emergent components, using experimental data from seven healthy
              young adults walking toward a target while avoiding collision
              with a stationary or moving obstacle (approaching head-on, or
              diagonally 30° left or right) in a virtual environment. Two
              linear properties from the predictive component enable the evader
              to predict the minimum distance between itself and the obstacle
              at all times, including the future intersection of trajectories.
              The emergent component uses the classical differential games
              model to solve for an optimal circumvention while reaching the
              target, wherein the locomotor strategy is influenced by the
              obstacle, target, and the evader velocity. Both model components
              were fitted to a different set of experimental data obtained from
              five poststroke and healthy participants to derive the minimum
              predicted distance (predictive component) and obstacle influence
              dimensions (emergent component) during circumvention. Minimum
              predicted distance between evader and pursuer was kept constant
              when the evader was closest to the obstacle in all participants.
              Obstacle influence dimensions varied depending on obstacle
              approach condition and preferred side of circumvention,
              reflecting differences in locomotor strategies between poststroke
              and healthy individuals. Additionally, important associations
              between model outputs and observed experimental outcomes were
              found. The model, supported by experimental data, suggests that
              both predictive and emergent processes can shape obstacle
              circumvention strategies in healthy and poststroke individuals.
              NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Obstacle circumvention during goal-directed
              locomotion is modeled with a new mathematical approach comprising
              both predictive and emergent elements. The major novelty is using
              differential games solutions to illustrate the dynamic
              interactions between the individual as an evader and the
              approaching obstacle as a pursuer. The model is supported by
              experimental evidence that explains the behavior along the

              direct experimental proof of the validity of these widely used
              control principles. Here we fill this gap by applying a control
              framework to the connectome of the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans, allowing us to predict the involvement of each C.
              elegans neuron in locomotor behaviours. We predict that control
              of the muscles or motor neurons requires 12 neuronal classes,
              which include neuronal groups previously implicated in locomotion
              by laser ablation, as well as one previously uncharacterized
              neuron, PDB. We validate this prediction experimentally, finding
              that the ablation of PDB leads to a significant loss of

              principles also allow us to investigate the involvement of
              individual neurons within each neuronal class. For example, we

              connections, and rewired connections in the current connectome,

              behavioral data sets, unsupervised clustering methods offer the
              potential of unbiased mapping of behavioral spaces. However,
              unsupervised techniques to map behavioral spaces are in their
              infancy, and there have been few systematic considerations of all
              the methodological options. We compared the performance of seven
              distinct mapping methods in clustering a wavelet-transformed data
              set consisting of the x- and y-positions of the six legs of
              individual flies. Legs were automatically tracked by small pieces
              of fluorescent dye, while the fly was tethered and walking on an
              air-suspended ball. We find that there is considerable variation
              in the performance of these mapping methods, and that better
              performance is attained when clustering is done in higher
              dimensional spaces (which are otherwise less preferable because
              they are hard to visualize). High dimensionality means that some
              algorithms, including the non-parametric watershed cluster

              watershed algorithm which can be used in high-dimensional spaces
              when a probability density estimate can be computed directly.
              With these tools in hand, we examined the behavioral space of fly
              leg postural dynamics and locomotion. We find a striking division
              of behavior into modes involving the fore legs and modes
              involving the hind legs, with few direct transitions between

                   However, our ability to understand how networks process

               Even for simple tasks, a detailed understanding of how recurrent
               networks work, or a prescription for how to develop such an
               understanding, remains elusive. In this work, we use tools from
               dynamical systems analysis to reverse engineer recurrent
               networks trained to perform sentiment classification, a
               foundational natural language processing task. Given a trained
               network, we find fixed points of the recurrent dynamics and
               linearize the nonlinear system around these fixed points.
               Despite their theoretical capacity to implement complex,

              neurobiological inferences one can draw from such efforts remains
              elusive. For example, to what extent does training neural
              networks to solve common tasks uniquely determine the network
              dynamics, independent of modeling architectural choices? Or
              alternatively, are the learned dynamics highly sensitive to
              different model choices? Knowing the answer to these questions
              has strong implications for whether and how we should use
              task-based RNN modeling to understand brain dynamics. To address
              these foundational questions, we study populations of thousands
              of networks, with commonly used RNN architectures, trained to
              solve neuroscientifically motivated tasks and characterize their
              nonlinear dynamics. We find the geometry of the RNN
              representations can be highly sensitive to different network
              architectures, yielding a cautionary tale for measures of
              similarity that rely on representational geometry, such as CCA.
              Moreover, we find that while the geometry of neural dynamics can
              vary greatly across architectures, the underlying computational
              scaffold-the topological structure of fixed points, transitions
              between them, limit cycles, and linearized dynamics-often appears
              universal across all architectures.",

  abstract = "The ability to simultaneously record from large numbers of
              neurons in behaving animals has ushered in a new era for the
              study of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive
              functions. One promising approach to uncovering the dynamical and
              computational principles governing population responses is to
              analyze model recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that have been
              optimized to perform the same tasks as behaving animals. Because
              the optimization of network parameters specifies the desired
              output but not the manner in which to achieve this output,
              ``trained'' networks serve as a source of mechanistic hypotheses
              and a testing ground for data analyses that link neural
              computation to behavior. Complete access to the activity and
              connectivity of the circuit, and the ability to manipulate them
              arbitrarily, make trained networks a convenient proxy for
              biological circuits and a valuable platform for theoretical
              investigation. However, existing RNNs lack basic biological
              features such as the distinction between excitatory and
              inhibitory units (Dale's principle), which are essential if RNNs
              are to provide insights into the operation of biological
              circuits. Moreover, trained networks can achieve the same
              behavioral performance but differ substantially in their
              structure and dynamics, highlighting the need for a simple and
              flexible framework for the exploratory training of RNNs. Here, we
              describe a framework for gradient descent-based training of
              excitatory-inhibitory RNNs that can incorporate a variety of
              biological knowledge. We provide an implementation based on the
              machine learning library Theano, whose automatic differentiation
              capabilities facilitate modifications and extensions. We validate
              this framework by applying it to well-known experimental
              paradigms such as perceptual decision-making, context-dependent
              integration, multisensory integration, parametric working memory,
              and motor sequence generation. Our results demonstrate the wide
              range of neural activity patterns and behavior that can be
              modeled, and suggest a unified setting in which diverse cognitive

               treated as black boxes: their mechanism of operation remains

  abstract = "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly being used to
              model complex cognitive and motor tasks performed by behaving
              animals. RNNs are trained to reproduce animal behavior while also
              capturing key statistics of empirically recorded neural activity.
              In this manner, the RNN can be viewed as an in silico circuit
              whose computational elements share similar motifs with the
              cortical area it is modeling. Furthermore, because the RNN's
              governing equations and parameters are fully known, they can be
              analyzed to propose hypotheses for how neural populations
              compute. In this context, we present important considerations
              when using RNNs to model motor behavior in a delayed reach task.
              First, by varying the network's nonlinear activation and rate
              regularization, we show that RNNs reproducing single-neuron
              firing rate motifs may not adequately capture important
              population motifs. Second, we find that even when RNNs reproduce
              key neurophysiological features on both the single neuron and
              population levels, they can do so through distinctly different
              dynamical mechanisms. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we
              show that an RNN consistent with a previously proposed dynamical
              mechanism is more robust to input noise. Finally, we show that
              these dynamics are sufficient for the RNN to generalize to tasks
              it was not trained on. Together, these results emphasize
              important considerations when using RNN models to probe neural

              neural network (RNN) may resemble empirical single-unit activity
              but not adequately capture important features on the neural
              population level. Dynamics of RNNs can be visualized in
              low-dimensional projections to provide insight into the RNN's
              dynamical mechanism. RNNs trained in different ways may reproduce
              neurophysiological motifs but do so with distinctly different
              mechanisms. RNNs trained to only perform a delayed reach task can

                   scratch to drive simulated cars from high-dimensional video
                   input. However, real brains are more powerful in many ways.
                   In particular, they learn a predictive model of their

                   abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning. Guided

               behaviors often make understanding elusive. Here, we review
               studies of animal pursuit and evasion --- two special classes of
               behavior where theory-driven experiments and new modeling
               techniques are beginning to uncover the general control
               principles underlying natural behavior. A key finding of these
               studies is that intricate sequences of pursuit and evasion
               behavior can often be constructed through simple, repeatable
               rules that link sensory input to motor output: we refer to these
               rules as behavioral algorithms. Identifying and mathematically
               characterizing these algorithms has led to important insights,
               including the discovery of guidance rules that attacking
               predators use to intercept mobile prey, and coordinated neural
               and biomechanical mechanisms that animals use to avoid impending
               collisions. Here, we argue that algorithms provide a good
               starting point for studies of natural behavior more generally.
               Rather than beginning at the neural or ecological levels of
               organization, we advocate starting in the middle, where the
               algorithms that link sensory input to behavioral output can
               provide a solid foundation from which to explore both the
               implementation and the ecological outcomes of behavior. We
               review insights that have been gained through such an
               algorithmic approach to pursuit and evasion behaviors. From
               these, we synthesize theoretical principles and lay out key
               modeling tools needed to apply an algorithmic approach to the
               study of other complex natural behaviors.",

               ``Neuropsychology of Anxiety''. It is based on two behavioural
               dimensions: 'defensive distance' as defined by the Blanchards
               and 'defensive direction'. Defensive direction is a categorical
               dimension with avoidance of threat corresponding to fear and
               approach to threat corresponding to anxiety. These two
               psychological dimensions are mapped to underlying neural
               dimensions. Defensive distance is mapped to neural level, with
               the shortest defensive distances involving the lowest neural
               level (periaqueductal grey) and the largest defensive distances
               the highest neural level (prefrontal cortex). Defensive
               direction is mapped to separate parallel streams that run across
               these levels. A significant departure from prior models is the
               proposal that both fear and anxiety are represented at all
               levels. The theory is presented in a simplified form that does
               not incorporate the interactions that must occur between
               non-adjacent levels of the system. It also requires expansion to
               include the dimension of escapability of threat. Our current

               as a framework that can revealingly synthesize a wide variety of

               on constructs from control theory (forward models) and signal
               processing (Kalman filters). The idea is that in addition to
               simply engaging with the body and environment, the brain
               constructs neural circuits that act as models of the body and
               environment. During overt sensorimotor engagement, these models
               are driven by efference copies in parallel with the body and
               environment, in order to provide expectations of the sensory
               feedback, and to enhance and process sensory information. These
               models can also be run off-line in order to produce imagery,
               estimate outcomes of different actions, and evaluate and develop
               motor plans. The framework is initially developed within the
               context of motor control, where it has been shown that inner
               models running in parallel with the body can reduce the effects
               of feedback delay problems. The same mechanisms can account for
               motor imagery as the off-line driving of the emulator via
               efference copies. The framework is extended to account for
               visual imagery as the off-line driving of an emulator of the
               motor-visual loop. I also show how such systems can provide for
               amodal spatial imagery. Perception, including visual perception,
               results from such models being used to form expectations of, and
               to interpret, sensory input. I close by briefly outlining other
               cognitive functions that might also be synthesized within this

              relevance the abstract setting is similar: we have an agent
              choosing actions over time, an uncertain dynamical system whose
              state is affected by those actions, and a performance criterion
              that the agent seeks to optimize. Solving problems of this kind
              remains hard, in part, because of overly generic formulations.
              Here, we propose a more structured formulation that greatly
              simplifies the construction of optimal control laws in both
              discrete and continuous domains. An exhaustive search over

               space, but with weights dependent on local morphogenetic
               substances, or morphogens. The morphogens are in turn effected
               by the passage of an organism. The evolution of the morphogens,
               and the corresponding flow of the organisms constitutes the
               collective behavior of the group. Such models have various types
               of phase transitions and self-organizing properties controlled
               both by the level of the noise, and other parameters. The model
               is then applied to the specific case of ants moving on a
               lattice. The local behavior of the ants is inspired by the
               actual behavior observed in the laboratory, and analytic results
               for the collective behavior are compared to the corresponding
               laboratory results. It is hoped that the present model might
               serve as a paradigmatic example of a complex cooperative system
               in nature. In particular swarm models can be used to explore the
               relation of nonequilibrium phase transitions to at least three
               important issues encountered in artificial life. Firstly, that
               of emergence as complex adaptive behavior. Secondly, as an
               exporation of continuous phase transitions in biological
               systems. Lastly, to derive behavioral criteria for the evolution

               role in the organization of the phase structure of such systems.
               Consequently, it is not possible to fully understand the
               behavior of these systems without explicitly incorporating the
               fluctuations. In particular, for the class of models studied
               here the effect of internal fluctuations due to finite size is a
               renormalized \{\textbackslashit decrease\} in the temperature
               near the point of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We briefly

  abstract = "The basal ganglia, in particular the striatum, are central to
              theories of behavioral control, and often identified as a seat of
              action selection. Reinforcement learning (RL) models--which have
              driven much recent experimental work on this region--cast
              striatum as a dynamic controller, integrating sensory and
              motivational information to construct efficient and enriching
              behavioral policies. Befitting this informationally central role,
              the BG sit at the nexus of multiple anatomical 'loops' of
              synaptic projections, connecting a wide range of cortical and
              subcortical structures. Numerous pioneering anatomical studies
              conducted over the past several decades have meticulously
              catalogued these loops, and labeled them according to the
              inferred functions of the connected regions. The specific
              cotermina of the projections are highly localized to several
              different subregions of the striatum, leading to the suggestion
              that these subregions perform complementary but distinct
              functions. However, until recently, the dominant computational
              framework outlined only a bipartite, dorsal/ventral, division of
              striatum. We review recent computational and experimental
              advances that argue for a more finely fractionated delineation.
              In particular, experimental data provide extensive insight into
              unique functions subserved by the dorsomedial striatum (DMS).
              These functions appear to correspond well with theories of a
              'model-based' RL subunit, and may also shed light on the
              suborganization of ventral striatum. Finally, we discuss the
              limitations of these ideas and how they point the way toward
              future refinements of neurocomputational theories of striatal
              function, bringing them into contact with other areas of
              computational theory and other regions of the brain.",

                   be carefully and comprehensively mapped in individual humans
                   and animals. Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge to
                   understand how the brain's structural wiring supports
                   cognitive processes, with major implications for the
                   personalized treatment of mental health disorders. Here, we
                   review recent efforts to meet this challenge that draw on
                   intuitions, models, and theories from physics, spanning the
                   domains of statistical mechanics, information theory, and
                   dynamical systems and control. We begin by considering the
                   organizing principles of brain network architecture
                   instantiated in structural wiring under constraints of
                   symmetry, spatial embedding, and energy minimization. We
                   next consider models of brain network function that
                   stipulate how neural activity propagates along these
                   structural connections, producing the long-range
                   interactions and collective dynamics that support a rich
                   repertoire of system functions. Finally, we consider
                   perturbative experiments and models for brain network
                   control, which leverage the physics of signal transmission
                   along structural wires to infer intrinsic control processes
                   that support goal-directed behavior and to inform
                   stimulation-based therapies for neurological disease and

                   questions in the physics of brain network structure,

  abstract  = "Recent work has given rise to the view that reward-based
               decision making is governed by two key controllers: a habit
               system, which stores stimulus-response associations shaped by
               past reward, and a goal-oriented system that selects actions
               based on their anticipated outcomes. The current literature
               provides a rich body of computational theory addressing habit
               formation, centering on temporal-difference learning mechanisms.
               Less progress has been made toward formalizing the processes
               involved in goal-directed decision making. We draw on recent
               work in cognitive neuroscience, animal conditioning, cognitive
               and developmental psychology, and machine learning to outline a
               new theory of goal-directed decision making. Our basic proposal
               is that the brain, within an identifiable network of cortical
               and subcortical structures, implements a probabilistic
               generative model of reward, and that goal-directed decision
               making is effected through Bayesian inversion of this model. We
               present a set of simulations implementing the account, which
               address benchmark behavioral and neuroscientific findings, and
               give rise to a set of testable predictions. We also discuss the
               relationship between the proposed framework and other models of

               dimensionality: the number of parameters to be learned grows
               exponentially with the size of any compact encoding of a state.
               Recent attempts to combat the curse of dimensionality have
               turned to principled ways of exploiting temporal abstraction,
               where decisions are not required at each step, but rather invoke
               the execution of temporally-extended activities which follow
               their own policies until termination. This leads naturally to
               hierarchical control architectures and associated learning
               algorithms. We review several approaches to temporal abstraction
               and hierarchical organization that machine learning researchers
               have recently developed. Common to these approaches is a
               reliance on the theory of semi-Markov decision processes, which

                   scratch to drive simulated cars from high-dimensional video
                   input. However, real brains are more powerful in many ways.
                   In particular, they learn a predictive model of their
                   initially unknown environment, and somehow use it for
                   abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning. Guided
                   by algorithmic information theory, we describe RNN-based AIs
                   (RNNAIs) designed to do the same. Such an RNNAI can be
                   trained on never-ending sequences of tasks, some of them
                   provided by the user, others invented by the RNNAI itself in
                   a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world

                   query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and
                   decision making, essentially ``learning to think.'' The

               Pfeifer and Josh Bongard demonstrate that thought is not
               independent of the body but is tightly constrained, and at the
               same time enabled, by it. They argue that the kinds of thoughts
               we are capable of have their foundation in our embodiment---in
               our morphology and the material properties of our bodies.This
               crucial notion of embodiment underlies fundamental changes in
               the field of artificial intelligence over the past two decades,
               and Pfeifer and Bongard use the basic methodology of artificial
               intelligence---``understanding by building''---to describe their
               insights. If we understand how to design and build intelligent
               systems, they reason, we will better understand intelligence in
               general. In accessible, nontechnical language, and using many
               examples, they introduce the basic concepts by building on
               recent developments in robotics, biology, neuroscience, and
               psychology to outline a possible theory of intelligence. They
               illustrate applications of such a theory in ubiquitous
               computing, business and management, and the psychology of human
               memory. Embodied intelligence, as described by Pfeifer and

              requiring flexible yet prompt behavior, a balance that has been
              characterized in terms of a trade-off between a slower,
              prospective goal-directed model-based (MB) strategy and a fast,
              retrospective habitual model-free (MF) strategy. Theory predicts
              that flexibility to changes in both reward values and transition
              contingencies can determine the relative influence of the two
              systems in reinforcement learning, but few studies have
              manipulated the latter. Therefore, we developed a novel two-level
              contingency change task in which transition contingencies between
              states change every few trials; MB and MF control predict
              different responses following these contingency changes, allowing
              their relative influence to be inferred. Additionally, we
              manipulated the rate of contingency changes in order to determine
              whether contingency change volatility would play a role in
              shifting subjects between a MB and MF strategy. We found that
              human subjects employed a hybrid MB/MF strategy on the task,

              human subjects utilizing a hybrid strategy that shifts towards
